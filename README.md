# Quoridor
Quoridor game implementation

This implements an instance of the Quoridor game. Game rules can be found here: https://www.ultraboardgames.com/quoridor/game-rules.php

A instance of the quoridor game must be initialized from the QuoridorGame class. Players should then take turns and the game will reflect when a win occurs. 

Players can take turns either placing a fence or moving their pawn. A fence may not be placed in a manner that completely blocks the other player's pawn from reaching their objective. This is checked for in each fence placement.
